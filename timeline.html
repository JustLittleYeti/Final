                                    Malcolm and Angus Young formed AC/DC with bassist Larry Van Kriedt, vocalist Dave Evans,
                                    and ex-Masters Apprentices drummer Colin Burgess. Gene Pierson booked the band to play
                                    at Chequers nightclub on New Year's Eve, 1973. In its early days, most members of the band
                                    dressed in some form of glam or satin outfit. On stage, Evans was occasionally replaced by
                                    the band's first manager, Dennis Laughlin, who was the original lead singer with Sherbet.

                                    The group released two albums -- High Voltage and T.N.T. -- in Australia in 1974 and 1975.
                                    Material from the two records comprised the 1976 release High Voltage in the U.S. and U.K.;
                                    the group also toured both countries. In the fall of 1977, AC/DC released Let There Be Rock,
                                    which became their first album to chart in the U.S. Mark Evans left the band soon after, with
                                    Cliff Williams taking his place. Powerage, released in spring of 1978, expanded their audience even
                                    further, thanks in no small part to their dynamic live shows. What really broke the doors down for
                                    the band was the following year's Highway to Hell, which hit number 17 in the U.S. and number eight
                                    in the U.K., becoming the group's first million-seller.</p>

                                  coroner's report stated he had "drunk himself to death." In March, the band replaced Scott with
                                  Brian Johnson. The following month, the band recorded Back in Black, which would prove to be its
                                  biggest album, selling over ten million copies in the U.S. alone.</p>

                                  Rick Rubin, the album received some of the most positive reviews of AC/DC's career; it also

                                <p class="mb-4">As AC/DC began work on a new album with producer Brendan O'Brien in 2014, they
                                  announced that Malcolm Young was suffering from dementia and had left the band; his nephew
                                  Stevie Young took his place at the recording sessions and the accompanying 40th anniversary tour,
                                  and subsequently joined the group full-time. Just prior to the December release of Rock or Bust,
                                  drummer Phil Rudd was arrested under charges of attempting to procure a murder, threatening to kill,
                                  and possession of cannabis and methamphetamine. Although the arranged murder charges were dropped,
                                  the other charges remained and the drummer's future with the band was uncertain. Nevertheless, AC/DC
                                  marched forward with the release of Rock or Bust and plans for a tour in 2015. Two years later,
                                  Malcolm Young died in November 2017 at the age of 64.</p>
